# Installation Guide

## Installing Dependencies

Install all the application dependencies:
```
npm ci
```

## Dynamodb Setup 

In order to test the application locally, a DynamoDB instance must be setup.

There are two options to setup a DynamoDB instance.

#### 1) Using Docker

Pull the image:
```
docker pull amazon/dynamodb-local
```

***Don't start*** the container with `docker run` command, instead run:

```
npm run start:db
```
This will run the container and create the tables properly.

#### 2) Using local DynamoDB instance

Install database:
```
npm run install:db
```
In the file `serverless.yml`, follow the path `custom > dynamodb > start` and edit the docker flag to `docker: false`

Start database:
```
npm run start:db
```

## Running the Application

There are two options to run the application locally.

#### 1) Serverless Offline

To start the application simulating the serverless environment, open a terminal window, and run:
```
npm run dev:sls
```

Routes exposed:

  - `POST` | http://localhost:3333/transaction/transfer                   
  - `POST` | http://localhost:3333/transaction/investment    

## Testing Routes With Postman/Insomnia

#### Route: `/user/account`

Make a `POST` request with a valid CPF in the body. JSON example:
```
{
  "cpf":"36577946035"
}
```

#### Route: `transaction/transfer`

Make a `POST` request with a valid transfer transaction in the body. JSON example:
```
{
	"event":"TRANSFER",
	"target": {
		"bank":"352",
		"branch":"0001",
		"account":"1"
	},
	"origin":{
		"bank":"033",
		"branch":"03312",
		"cpf":"36577946035"
	},
	"amount":5000
}
```

#### Route: `transaction/investment`

Make a `POST` request with a valid investment transaction in the body. JSON example:

{
  "event": "INVESTMENT",
  "stock": "PETR4",
  "quantity": 100,
  "cpf": "17638119134"
}
```

## Running Automated Tests

#### Unit and Integration Tests

To run the unit and integration tests, run:
```
npm run test
```
This tests don't depend on database setup, neither on running the application.

#### End-to-End Tests

To run the end-to-end tests, run:
```
npm run test:e2e
```

***These tests depend on database setup.***

âš  Be aware: these tests will clean **all** of the local database entries on completion.
